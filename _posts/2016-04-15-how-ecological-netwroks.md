Biogeographers have long been fascinated by the picture of species distributions and questioned how it could have been made, i.e. searching for the processes shaping biodiversity on Earth.
Starting from the clear relationship between abiotic variables and the physiological constraints of organisms, large-scale studies have been conducted in a pattern-driven perspective making Biogeography a realm of correlations. Such an approach have provided many valuable knowledge along with the development of efficient statistical tools. However, in the context of global changes, many researchers claim for a renewal of the theoretical foundations of the field towards a Biogeography mechanism-driven.

Ecological interactions are one of the many concerns regarding this request. Briefly, the problem regards whether or not relationships among organisms must be taken into account to explain species distribution. Historically, authors have assumed that these interactions could be neglected at large geographical scales. This assumption has puzzled some researchers wondering what can prevent such a fundamental component at the community scale from being important at larger spatial scales. On the one hand, abiotic variables may indeed be the main drivers of species presence at large spatial scales and the effects of interactions, although locally crucial, may be inappreciable at coarser spatial scales. On the other hand, there is a methodological issue at the core of which, the independence among species have been hypothesized when adequate datasets were not available.

To test whether or not interactions are important for species distributions, information is needed regarding (1) realized interactions and (2) the presence for all the interacting species over a broad spatial extent. Based on such datasets, we demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that interacting species co-occur differently from species that do not interact. Also, we were able to show that species separated by more than 3 links are statistically independent. Our results first endorse that ecological interactions affect species distribution and therefore stress the need for stronger theoretical foundations in Biogeography. Second, we highlight that capturing the whole complexity of networks may not be necessary to improve predictions of species distribution. Taken together our results imply that the relative position of two species within an ecological network is a valuable source of information that species distribution models must integrate to better deal with the assumption that species are independent.
