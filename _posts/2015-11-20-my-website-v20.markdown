#### Welcome random visitor!

This is the first post on my new website. I now take advantage from the powerful technologies such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [font-awsome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), [YAML](http://yaml.org) that I have now adopted. I would like to thank a lot [Steve Vissault](http://www.steve-vissault.me) for introducing me to Jekyll and for the hints he gave me. To get potential feed-back on my posts, I added a [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) part. Questions about how this website was made are welcome. All the code I use is available on [Github](https://github.com/KevCaz/KevCazWebsite).

I have also taken the opportunity to edit previous posts and delete the one that explained how the previous website was built. I have also removed some material that I will make available again as dedicated posts. I will push myself to make all the code developed on [Github](https://github.com/KevCaz). Also, as I love producing figures with R, I added a [new section]({{site.baseurl}}/blogR) dedicated to this topic.
